2.Evaluate them based on two main criteria:
a. Coverage: Are all acceptance criteria and requirements covered? Are negative, edge, and boundary cases considered?
b. Redundancy: Are there near-identical scenarios that should be collapsed into one parameterized scenario?   
3.Calculate a confidence score from 0 to 100 representing how good the scenarios are. 
4.Provide detailed feedback explaining what needs to be improved, and list the strengths and gaps. 
5.Return ONLY a valid JSON object matching the required structure.
